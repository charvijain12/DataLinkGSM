# Data-over-GSM-voice-channel

This project is designed to enable data transmission over a GSM voice channel. The project makes use of a technique called frequency shift keying (FSK), which allows data to be transmitted by modulating the frequency of an audio signal. The project is implemented using a Python script that can be run on any computer with a sound card and a GSM modem.

## Installation and Usage

1. Install `Python 3.x` on your computer.

2. Connect your `sound card` and `GSM modem` to your computer.

3. Install the required Python packages by running the following command in your terminal: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Run the Python script by typing `python main.py` in your terminal.

5. Follow the instructions in the console to enter your message and phone number.


## Limitations
1. The project only works with GSM networks.

2. The transmission speed is limited to the bandwidth of the GSM voice channel.

3. The project is not designed for large-scale data transmission.
