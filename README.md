# DataLinkGSM: Data Transmission Over GSM Voice Channel

DataLinkGSM project is designed to enable data transmission over a GSM voice channel. The project makes use of a technique called frequency shift keying (FSK), which allows data to be transmitted by modulating the frequency of an audio signal. The project is implemented using a Python script that can be run on any computer with a sound card and a GSM modem.

## Installation and Usage

1. Install `Python 3.x` on your computer.

2. Connect your `sound card` and `GSM modem` to your computer.

3. Install the required Python packages by running the following command in your terminal: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Run the Python script by typing `python main.py` in your terminal.

5. Follow the instructions in the console to enter your message and phone number.


## Limitations
1. DataLinkGSM only works with GSM networks.

2. The transmission speed is limited to the bandwidth of the GSM voice channel.

3. DataLinkGSM is not designed for large-scale data transmission.
